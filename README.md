* Truckpool is an eco-friendly, cost- effective and time-saving solution for a Truck-Sharing System. 

* The web-application puts truck drivers in contact with customers wishing to send goods to other cities. 

* Optimization algorithms are used in this platform in order to maximize the truckâ€™s capacity given a set of cargos, and increase the number of deliveries per journey while optimizing the delivery time.

* The idea emerged after noticing the main issues of the current transportation system: it is time-consuming, money-wasting, and unsustainable on the long run.

* Truckpool aims to cut gas emissions by using scheduling algorithms, especially greedy algorithms as optimization problems are being considered.

* All in all, in this website, private truck owners and drivers can post their location, itinerary, truck size and payload capacity. 

* The target clients are: companies and individuals who are looking for a quick way to deliver their merchandise; and private truck owners wishing to find new clients.

* These shipments can be at regional, national or international scale (precisely Europe, and North Africa).

* By creating a service platform which puts companies and individual in touch with truck-drivers, they will be able to proceed with a quick, efficient and profitable way to deliver merchandise and products. The time- and money-consumption issue would eventually be resolved. Furthermore, the truck-sharing system would potentially reduce gas emissions and help with the environmental concerns.

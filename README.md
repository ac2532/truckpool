* Truckpool is an eco-friendly, cost effective and time-saving Truck-Sharing System implemented using the framework Django.

* The web-application puts truck drivers in contact with customers wishing to send their goods to other cities. 

* These shipments can be at regional, national or international scale (precisely Europe, and North Africa).

* The target clients are: 
 - companies and individuals who are looking for a quick way to deliver their merchandise
 - private truck owners wishing to find new clients

* Optimization algorithms are used in this platform to:
 1. maximize the truckâ€™s capacity 
 2. increase the number of deliveries per journey 
 3. reduce the delivery time
 
* Truckpool aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by using scheduling algorithms and coordinating the deliveries

* The idea emerged after noticing the main issues of the current transportation system: it is time-consuming, money-wasting, and unsustainable in the long run.

* By creating this service platform truck drivers will be able to proceed with a quick, efficient and profitable way to deliver cargoes.
